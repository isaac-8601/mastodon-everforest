# Everforest for Mastodon

Supports both variants (dark, light) and three contrast settings (soft, medium, hard).

**This is very early in development**, so while Mastodon will be usable there will be quite a few unstyled elements and lack of parity between dark and light theme. (Dark themes are being tested more often.)

## Usage

1. Set your Mastodon theme to dark style.
2. Add the [Stylus extension](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus) to your browser.
3. Visit [this link](https://github.com/isaac-8601/mastodon-everforest/raw/main/everforest.user.css) and click the install button.
4. Add your Mastodon server's domain name to the list of domains near the top of the stylesheet.
5. Set your preferred palette settings in the customization menu for Mastodon Everforest.
